# RadioFreeNature
Just your friendly neighborhood grad student, legitimately and conveniently sharing full text of articles of interest with colleagues without a subscription.

## How it works

1. You send @RadioFreeNature a tweet w/ a link or doi for a Nature paper
2. I look it up 
3. I share the Readcube link with you
4. I save your request and the link in a little database
